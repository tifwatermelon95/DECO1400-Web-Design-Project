# DECO1400 - Dress Hiring Website Implementation

## 4 JavaScript Usages:

- HOMEPAGE - Implementation of horizontal scrolling carousel for the dress section of the Homepage when users click on the back and next buttons.
- DRESSES FOR HIRE > WEDDING GUEST DRESSES - Implementation of size filtering functionality for wedding guest dresses.
- HOW IT WORKS PAGE - Implementation of accordion in the Q & A
- CONTACT FORM PAGE - Pop-up alert when users submit form & resets the form.

## Cool Features
- Animation of the Hero Strip Message "Affordable designer dress for every occasion - 
because looking good shouldn't cost the earth..." in the Homepage when the page opens up or refreshes.

## Important Note:
The following features have not been implemented:
- Product Details page. This should open up whenever you press on a 'Size' available for a particular dress. 
Right now when you press on a size it doesn't link to anything.
- Dresses for Hire (Dropdown Navigation Bar) - only the Wedding Guest page has been implemented to show what it
would look like. The other categories (e.g. Floral Dresses, Party + Going Out Dresses, Cocktail Dresses) do 
not link to anything as they have not been implemented but it should look like the exact format & layout as the
Wedding Guest page.
- Footer has not been implemented. 
- Book a Try On page - calendar is not interactive. 
- Account/Cart page - not interactive.
- Breadcrumb navigation & backwards button not implemented on the pages shown in high-fidelity.
- Other than the above mentioned, all the other pages should have content on it be linked to all the other pages.
